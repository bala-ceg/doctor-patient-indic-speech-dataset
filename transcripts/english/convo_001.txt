Hello. Come in, have a seat. I’m Dr. Mehta. What problem have you come in for?

Hello, doctor. For the past two weeks I’ve been feeling very tired. I’m also getting frequent headaches.

Okay. Does the headache stay all the time, or does it come only sometimes?

Only sometimes. Especially in the evenings it gets worse. Sometimes I also feel a bit dizzy.

I understand. Are you getting proper sleep? Are you eating on time?

Work stress is high, doctor. Because of that, my sleep isn’t proper. Sometimes I even skip meals.

That could be the reason. Let’s do a simple blood test. We can check if there is anemia or vitamin deficiency.

Alright, doctor. Is this something serious?

No need to worry right now. This is a common issue. Once the reports come, I’ll tell you what to do next.

Thank you, doctor. I feel a bit relieved now.

That’s why we’re here. Eat on time, drink plenty of water, and make sure you get proper sleep. Once the reports are ready, we’ll meet again.

Okay, doctor. Thank you very much.
